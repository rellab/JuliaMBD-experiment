# JuliaMBD experiments

## Experiment 1

- Compare JuliaMBD with Simulink on METI_Vertical_Vibration in JAMBE
- Check the outputs of simulation models (12 outputs)
- Check the outputs of each model
- Measure the compilation time and the time for simulation

## Experiment 2

- Compare JuliaMBD with the old version of JuliaMBD which is before the refactoring
